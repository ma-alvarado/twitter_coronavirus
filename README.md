# Coronavirus analysis
# My code ran through every tweet sent from October 1, 2019 to April 5, 2020, looking for key coronavirus hashtags. For each tweet that qualified, I captured
# the origin country and language. All the language and country results were captured in reduced.lang and reduced.country respectively. A visualization of these results
# can be found in visualization_country and visualization_lang. Each of these directories contain output files for each tweet I searched for and 
# provides my findings. 

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on twitter.
